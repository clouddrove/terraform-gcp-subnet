We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-subnet/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default subnet
```hcl
module "subnet" {
  source = "clouddrove/subnet/google"

  name        = "dev"
  environment = var.environment
  label_order = var.label_order
  gcp_region  = "us-central1"

  google_compute_subnetwork_enabled  = true
  google_compute_firewall_enabled    = true
  google_compute_router_nat_enabled  = true
  module_enabled                     = true
  ipv6_access_type                   = "EXTERNAL"
  network                            = module.vpc.vpc_id
  project_id                         = "clouddrove"
  private_ip_google_access           = true
  allow                              = [{ "protocol" : "tcp", "ports" : ["1-65535"] }]
  source_ranges                      = ["10.10.0.0/16"]
  asn                                = 64514
  nat_ip_allocate_option             = "MANUAL_ONLY"
  source_subnetwork_ip_ranges_to_nat = "ALL_SUBNETWORKS_ALL_IP_RANGES"
  filter                             = "ERRORS_ONLY"
  dest_range                         = "0.0.0.0/0"
  next_hop_gateway                   = "default-internet-gateway"
  priority                           = 1000
  secondary_ip_ranges = [
    {
      "range_name" : "services",
      "ip_cidr_range" : "10.1.0.0/16"
    },

    {
      "range_name" : "pods",
      "ip_cidr_range" : "10.3.0.0/16"
    }
  ]
}
```






## Inputs

| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| filter | Specifies the desired filtering of logs on this NAT. | `string` | `""` | no |
| gcp\_region | Google Cloud region | `string` | `"europe-west3"` | no |

| google\_compute\_subnetwork\_enabled | n/a | `bool` | `true` | no |
| ip\_cidr\_range | (Required) The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16. Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. | `string` | `"10.10.0.0/24"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|

| name | GCS bucket name. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
